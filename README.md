Hi there, I'm Harshal Hirpara! 👋

I'm an aspiring 🚀 ML engineer and M.S. Computer Science student @ University of Illinois Chicago 🌆

I love building intelligent systems to make an impact on real-world problems. 💡

My superpowers include Python, deep learning, NLP, computer vision, and more! 🐍🧠👀

Check out some of my recent projects:

  - Emotion Recognition with Face Mask 😷: Created a CNN to classify emotions from masked faces using OpenCV and Keras. Paper published in IEEE conference! ✍️

  - SCIPASUMM 📜: Working on an end-to-end paper summarization pipeline using NLP techniques like BERT.

  - Lithium Ion Battery 🔋: Built a forecasting model using TensorFlow to estimate battery capacity. ≤4% error!

  - Robotic Arm 🤖: Trained a simulated robotic arm to grab objects using reinforcement learning algorithms.

  - Plant Disease Classification 🌱: Created an image classifier using ResNet to identify 38 different plant diseases. 🌳

There's so much more I'm learning and building as an aspiring ML engineer. Let's chat! I'm always happy to connect with others passionate about AI. 😊
